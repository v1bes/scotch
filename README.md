Scotch is a  [bourbon.io](http://bourbon.io)  based SASS framework which mainly uses mixins and vars to keep your compiled css as small as possible.
Unlike bourbon, scotch includes a (not so realy) grid system wich is just some useful shortcuts for CSS-GRID.
It also includes normalize.css and font-awesome (or some icon font).

### copy from bourbon:
- [ ] all-buttons
- [ ] all-buttons-active
- [ ] all-buttons-focus
- [ ] all-buttons-hover ?
- [ ] clearfix
- [ ] ellipsis
- [ ] shade
- [ ] all-text-inputs
- [ ] all-text-inputs-active
- [ ] all-text-inputs-focus
- [ ] all-text-inputs-hover ?
- [ ] all-text-inputs-invalid ?
- [ ] tint
- [ ] triangle
- [ ] visual-grid (if possible) ?

### add new:
- [ ] simple box-shadows
- [ ] default buttons
- [ ] default inputs
- [ ] nice gradients
- [ ] Flexbox mixins

### Ideas
* Blended (ui for designers to set vars and stuff and generate a slightly different version of scotch)
	* possible payed service (web-interface wich updates the scotch files automatically)
* Islay ( branch or different version of scotch with less/different features)
* Spayside (same as islay but different)
* easy and useful integration in angular, vue, React, â€¦ ember?
